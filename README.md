# Is-HIPEC-a-safe-and-effective-treatment-for-ovarian-cancer-

Yes, HIPEC (Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy) has shown great results in many patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Itâ€™s a special technique where, after all visible cancer is removed from the abdomen, heated chemo is circulated directly inside to kill any remaining cancer cells.

Why is it considered effective? Because:

It delivers chemo directly to where the cancer was

Heat boosts the chemoâ€™s power

It avoids harming the rest of the body too much

It can reduce cancer recurrence

Studies have shown that HIPEC can increase overall survival and disease-free survival in ovarian cancer when done with proper surgery (cytoreduction). Itâ€™s especially useful for cancers that have spread inside the belly or come back again.

As for safety, yesâ€”when done by trained surgeons in proper facilities, HIPEC is quite safe. Itâ€™s a long surgery (sometimes 6â€“8 hours), so the patient must be fit, and the hospital must have a strong ICU setup.

Dr. Nitin Singhal in Ahmedabad offers HIPEC for suitable ovarian cancer cases. He is trained from Tata Memorial and has done many of these complex procedures safely. He guides patients clearly on whether HIPEC is right for them or not, depending on their age, stage, and overall health.
